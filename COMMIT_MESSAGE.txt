fix(augmentation): use modern tools format for CycloneDX 1.5+

Previously, we were forcing all tools to the deprecated legacy format
(tools array) regardless of CycloneDX version. This change makes our
implementation version-aware and spec-compliant.

Changes:
- CycloneDX 1.4: Uses legacy Tool format (tools array) as required
- CycloneDX 1.5+: Uses modern format (tools.components/tools.services)
- Sbomify added as Service in 1.5+ (appropriate for API-based tools)
- Never use OrganizationalEntity for tools (confirmed correct in audit)

Technical details:
- Added spec_version parameter to augment_cyclonedx_sbom()
- Updated _add_sbomify_tool_to_cyclonedx() with version detection
- For 1.5+: Keep existing components/services, add sbomify to services
- For 1.4: Convert components/services to legacy Tool format

Why this matters:
- Follows CycloneDX spec correctly for each version
- Modern format (1.5+) is preferred and not deprecated
- Service-based tools belong in tools.services per spec
- Maintains backward compatibility with 1.4

Testing:
- All schema compliance tests pass (1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7)
- New test for 1.4 legacy format
- Updated tests to check correct locations (services vs tools)
- Full test suite passes with 68% coverage

Fixes:
- Tool metadata now respects spec version
- No longer converts modern format to deprecated legacy format
- Sbomify correctly identified as service-based tool
