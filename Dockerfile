# git is needed at runtime and is deliberately baked in rather than fetched
# like the generators are. Nearly every path wants it: the wizard reads repo
# facts (remote name, branch, visibility) from the bind-mounted workspace,
# submodule resolution runs it directly, and run_command threads
# git_safe_directory_env() into *every* subprocess because the generators
# shell out to tools that run git themselves -- composer establishing its
# root package version, cargo, go. Slim images don't ship it, and without it
# those facts silently degrade to folder-name and "unknown" visibility.
#
# So this is the one dependency that should never be lazy-loaded: a tool
# needed by almost every run is not a tool to go and fetch mid-run.
# dist-upgrade first: the base image digest lags the Debian security
# archive, so packages preinstalled in the base (util-linux, openssl)
# would otherwise ship at whatever patch level the digest froze.

# A home that stays writable whatever uid the caller supplies.
#
# The image still runs as root by default -- GitHub requires that of a
# container action -- but plenty of callers override it. Jenkins' Docker
# Pipeline plugin passes `-u <uid>:<gid>` by default, and anyone running
# `docker run --user` locally does the same. A uid with no passwd entry gets
# HOME=/, which it cannot write.
#
# That is not a cosmetic problem. cosign keeps its TUF trust root in
# $HOME/.sigstore, so it cannot verify a bundle's attestation, and refusing
# an unverifiable binary is a hard stop by design. Measured against the
# published image with `-u 1000:1000`: every ecosystem that fetches a bundle
# (Go, Rust, .NET, Dart, JVM, npm, PHP) fails with
#
#     Attestation verification failed ... mkdir /.sigstore: permission denied
#
# and only Python survives, because cyclonedx-py is in the venv and needs no
# bundle. The failure reads as a supply-chain problem rather than a
# permissions one, which is why it went unnoticed.
#
# World-writable rather than group-writable: the uid arrives at run time, so
# no narrower grant covers it. What lives here is a per-run cache and the
# trust root, inside a single-tenant ephemeral container. Deliberately NOT
# `--gid 0`: measured against this image, primary gid 0 grants access to
# exactly three apt/dpkg lock files and nothing else, and it is overridden
# anyway the moment a caller passes `--user`.
