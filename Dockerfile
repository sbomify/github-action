# archive, so packages preinstalled in the base (util-linux, openssl)

#
# Nothing in the image depends on this path: GitHub Actions mounts the checkout
# at /github/workspace and passes its own -w, and CI systems whose Docker
# wrappers set the working directory to their agent's checkout path override it
# too. Both keep working, as does an explicit -w from an existing pipeline.
