"""CI runtime plugin architecture.

Resolves which CI system the action is running under and exposes everything
platform-specific behind one object, so the rest of the codebase never reads
``GITHUB_ACTIONS`` (or any other vendor variable) directly.

Platforms (in detection order):
- github-actions: GitHub Actions runner (priority 10)
- gitlab-ci: GitLab CI job (priority 20)
- bitbucket-pipelines: Bitbucket Pipelines step (priority 30)
- teamcity: TeamCity agent, VCS from the build properties file (priority 40)
- jenkins: Jenkins agent, VCS from the Git plugin's variables (priority 50)
- circleci: CircleCI executor, VCS from the job environment (priority 60)
- travis-ci: Travis CI worker, ref from the job environment (priority 70)
- generic-ci: any other recognised CI system, VCS from git (priority 90)
- local: developer machine, VCS from git (priority 100, always matches)

**Adding a CI platform** is one module under ``platforms/`` and one
``register()`` line below. Nothing else changes: console formatting, workspace
resolution, VCS augmentation, OIDC and telemetry all route through the
protocol. Subclass ``GitCheckoutPlatform`` when the system just checks out a
git repository; write the methods out when it publishes its own repository
details or needs a different log dialect.

Usage:
    from sbomify_action._runtime import get_platform

    platform = get_platform()
    workspace = platform.workspace()
    platform.log_formatter().warning("something looks off")

The platform is resolved on every call rather than cached, so a process that
changes its environment -- most often a test -- sees the change. Resolution is a
handful of environment lookups. Use :func:`use_platform` to pin one explicitly.

Nothing in this package may import from the rest of ``sbomify_action`` beyond
leaf modules (``exceptions``, ``http_client``): ``console`` resolves a platform
while it is still being imported, so a reach into ``_augmentation`` or
``logging_config`` would close an import cycle. That is why the VCS-URL helpers
and ``git_safe_directory_env`` live here, re-exported from their old homes.
