"""Generic CI platform for systems with no vendor integration.

Azure Pipelines, Buildkite, Drone and friends all check out a git repository
and run a command in it. That is enough: the checkout supplies VCS metadata via
``git``, and the working directory supplies the workspace. What we gain from
recognising the vendor by name is a useful ``ci.platform`` telemetry tag and,
where the vendor publishes one, the checkout path.

Adding a vendor here is a row in :data:`VENDORS`, not a new class. A vendor
graduates to its own platform module only when it needs something structural --
its own log dialect, an OIDC issuer, or repository metadata richer than git's.
