    ``GET /api/v1/workspaces/`` returns every workspace the underlying
    *user* belongs to, regardless of the token's scope (the backend does
    not filter that endpoint by token-bound team today). But
    ``list_products`` / ``list_components`` ARE scoped — to the token's
    bound team for scoped tokens, or the authenticating user's *default*
    workspace for PATs. Mirror that scoping by reading the
    ``is_default_workspace`` flag on the current user's membership entry,
    falling back to the deprecated ``is_default_team`` —
    the same signal the backend uses for the component listing.

    Caveat: for a *scoped* token bound to a non-default workspace, the
    membership block on the token's bound workspace still reads
    ``is_default_team=False`` (the flag tracks the user's default, not
    the token's scope), so this picker can return the wrong key. There's
    no programmatic disambiguation today — the picked workspace is
    surfaced in the auth-success status line so the user can spot a
    mismatch (eg. by seeing a workspace name they didn't expect) and
    re-run with the right token. When the token spans exactly one
    workspace (the common case for both unscoped PAT-with-one-team and
    scoped tokens correctly filtered backend-side), there's no
    ambiguity — return that key without consulting the flag.
