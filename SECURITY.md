## Security Best Practices for Users

When using sbomify-action in your workflows:

1. **Pin the action to a specific version tag** (e.g., `sbomify/sbomify-action@v0.14`) rather than `@master`
2. **Use minimum required permissions** in your workflow `permissions:` block
3. **Store API tokens as GitHub secrets** — never hardcode them in workflow files
4. **Review SBOM outputs** before uploading to ensure no sensitive information is included
